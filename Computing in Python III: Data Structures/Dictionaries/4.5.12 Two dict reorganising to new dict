#Write a function called stars that takes in two
#dictionaries:
#
# - movies: a dictionary where the keys are movie titles and
#   the values are lists of major performers in the movie. For
#   example: movies["The Dark Knight"] = ["Christian Bale",
#   "Heath Ledger", "Maggie Gyllenhall", "Aaron Eckhart"]
# - tvshows: a dictionary where the keys are TV show titles
#   and the values lists of major performers in the show.
#   For example: tvshows["Community"] = ["Joel McHale", "Alison
#   Brie", "Danny Pudi", "Donald Glover", "Yvette Brown"]
#
#The function stars should return a new dictionary. The keys
#of the new dictionary should be the performers' names, and
#the values for each key should be the list of shows and
#movies in which that performer has appeared. Sort the shows
#and movies alphabetically.

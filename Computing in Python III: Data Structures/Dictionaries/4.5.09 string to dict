#Write a new function called length_words so that
#the returned dictionary maps an integer, the length of a
#word, to a list of words from the sentence with that length.
#If a word occurs more than once, add it more than once. The
#words in the list should appear in the same order in which
#they appeared in the sentence. Remove any punctuation and make the
#string lowercase.

    myString = myString.lower()

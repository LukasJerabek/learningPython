#One-by-one,each player takes a shot. If they make the shot, the next person must make the same shot.
#If they do not, they receive a letter: H, then O, then R, then S, then E.
#Once a player receives all 5 letters, they are out of the game.
#
#The game continues until all but one player has all five
#letters.
#
#Write a function called check_horse_winner. This function
#will take as input a tuple of at least two, but potentially
#more, strings. 
#
#check_horse_winner should return the following:
#
# - If only one player is left with fewer than 5 letters,
#   return "Player X wins!", where X is the index of the
#   player in the list (which could be 0).
# - If more than one player has fewer than 5 letters,
#   return "Players X, Y: keep playing!", where X, Y, and
#   potentially more numbers are the indices of all players
#   who have not yet been eliminated.
# - If no player has 5 letters, return "Everyone: keep
#   playing!"

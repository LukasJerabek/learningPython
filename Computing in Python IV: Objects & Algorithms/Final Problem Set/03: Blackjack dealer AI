#These are the rules we'll use forour Blackjack-playing AI.
#The rules are:
# - The dealer must Hit if their total is below 17.
# - The dealer must Stay as soon as their total is 17 or
#   higher.
# - An Ace (A) should be counted as 11 if it puts the
#   dealer between 17 and 21 points. If it puts them over
#   21, though, it should be counted as 1.

#  The function should return one of three strings:
#
# - "Hit" if the dealer should take another card.
# - "Stay" if the dealer should not take another card.
# - "Bust" if the sum is already over 21.

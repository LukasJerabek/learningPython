#Write a function called generate_name. generate_name should have two parameters (strings).
#The first string = filename from which to read name parts.
#The second = individual person's name
#
#The first 26 lines in file are for the person's first name
#The last 26 lines in file are for the person's last name
#
#Your function should return the person's name according to
#the names in the file.

print(generate_name("heronames.txt", "Addison Zook"))
print(generate_name("heronames.txt", "Uma Irwin"))
